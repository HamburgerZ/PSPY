# PSPY
PSPY is a digital image processing framework developed by python. You can use PSPY to process digital image conveniently like photoshop and add your own funcitons and interfaces easily by python. 
PSPY is suitalbe for friends who start to study the knowledge of opencv.
# Requirement
- You should to install python3.</br> 
- You should install two lib:</br>
  - opencv_python</br>
  - wxpython</br>
- If you use the Windows, you could open the cmd and input:</br>
`
pip install opencv_python 
`</br>
`
pip install wxpython 
`
# Use
- You can clone down the project and open the 'Main_UI.py' to run the software.</br>

- If you touch the 'file' in the menu and select the 'open image' in the list, the image will be shown in the window</br>
And we can process the digital image easily.</br>
- for example, you can touch the 'process' in the menu and select the 'cvtcolor' in the list, 
the image will transform type of RGB to type of gray.After that,
you can select the 'threshold' in the same list and adjust the parameter by yourself, 
you will see the different binary image when you use different parameters.</br>

Of course,there are some other functions and I will introduce those next time.
